# Introduction

In scope of our project work, we have created a rework of our substitution plan system of our school. We have focused our targets to improve display style, handling and responsiveness. Also, we wanted to create this project to be run completely stand-alone with a connection to a MySQL server as database and an authentication server which is accessable via LDAP.

# Technology

## Front End

We have used HTML5 in combination with JavaScript for dynamically requesting data from the back end server using the native `XMLHttpRequest` library and building the interface structure.  
We have used [`zola`](https://github.com/getzola/zola) as site generator and template compiler to minify and simplify our front end source files. Also, we have used [`Bootstrap 4`](https://getbootstrap.com/) as design toolkit for a cleaner, more consistent and responsive design.

## Back End

For the REST API, database and authentication server access, we have decided to use the language [`Go`](https://golang.org/). Because of it's omtimization for web applications, the easy to maintain structure, the ability to cross-compile easy to deploy self-containing binaries and the variety of standard libraries *(`net/http` or `database/sql` for example)* and community driven open source packages *(like the gorilla web toolkit)*.

## Dependencies
