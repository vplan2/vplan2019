## MySQL Database Setup

Create a database which will be used for storing data for vPlan2. The recommendet name for the database is `vplan2`.  
Then, create a user, recommendet with the same name as the database (e.g. `vplan2`), and grant following privileges to the user for the created database:

```
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `testing`;
CREATE USER 'testing'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'someStrongPassword';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, 
    ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, EVENT, TRIGGER, 
    SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, EXECUTE 
    ON `testing`.* TO 'testing'@'%';
```

All other database structures will be automatically generated by the server on startup.
